Had to make something for my college web dev project. Too bad we had to use php and mysql and I wanted to do nodejs and postgres. So just minimal stuff here also only client, coz really I can't put php on my github that's emarassing xD (actually that's on heroku's git and idk how to put it here also imma git noob). Anyways you can check this app on [tiaw.now.sh](tiaw.now.sh). Proabably will [rewrite this out](https://github.com/devanshj/tiaw-client/issues/1) coz I did this in two days and it's not very noice but okay.
